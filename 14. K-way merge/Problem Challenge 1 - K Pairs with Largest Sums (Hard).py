Time complexity 
Since, at most, we’ll be going through all the elements of both arrays and we will add/remove one element in the heap in each step, 
the time complexity of the above algorithm will be O(N*M*logK) where ‘N’ and ‘M’ are the total number of elements in both arrays, respectively.

If we assume that both arrays have at least ‘K’ elements then the time complexity can be simplified to O(K^2logK), 
because we are not iterating more than ‘K’ elements in both arrays.

Space complexity 
The space complexity will be O(K) because, at any time, our Min Heap will be storing ‘K’ largest pairs.
