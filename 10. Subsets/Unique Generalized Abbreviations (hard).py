Time complexity 
Since we had two options for each character, we will have a maximum of 2^N combinations. 
If you see the visual representation of Example-1 closely you will realize that it is equivalent to a binary tree, 
where each node has two children. This means that we will have 2^N leaf nodes and 2^N-1 intermediate nodes, 
so the total number of elements pushed to the queue will be 2^N + 2^N-1, which is asymptotically equivalent to O(2^N). 
While processing each element, we do need to concatenate the current string with a character. 
This operation will take O(N), so the overall time complexity of our algorithm will be O(N*2^N).

Space complexity 
All the additional space used by our algorithm is for the output list. 
Since we canâ€™t have more than O(2^N) combinations, the space complexity of our algorithm is O(N*2^N).
